### Introduction

## Why Core Data?

Core Data is just a framework like UIKit. It is used to manage data/models. There are a couple of notable built-in features such as *1. change tracking of data, 2. undo and redo to data 3. Filtering 4. Save on to the disk. 5. Partial loading unlike UserDefaults*%
It is true that there are other frameworks built by non-Apple engineers such as Realm which acts like Core Data and feel free to use that instead. I’m not going to talk about pros and cons in this article. (I also don’t know much of it)...
